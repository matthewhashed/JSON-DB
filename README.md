# JSON-DB:
JSON-DB is a database that can be used to store values and retrieve values. It is almost completely written in [python](https://www.python.org/ "Official python website").

## How to use:
Simply import `json-db.py` to your python code and then create a file named `db.json`.
Then, you can use its functions to change values or retrieve values.

## Functions:
* `setValue(key, value)`
> This function creates and/or sets the value of a key.
* `getValue(key)`
> Returns the value of a key.
* `saveDatabase()`
> Saves all data to `db.json`.

Rules:
* You may NOT copy and resell this. **|** i.e: Bob sold a copy of JSON-DB
* You may use this to make something else. **|** i.e: Bob used JSON-DB to build a website
